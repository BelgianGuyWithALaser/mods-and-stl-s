#Webcam mount with gopro swivel


I was looking for a small footprint webcam for usage in the V2.4
I used this one (160 degree's version) : https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/32898413562.html

Installation is pretty straight forward.
Materials needed :
1x m3 heat insert (V2.4 style)
2x m3 T-nuts
2x m3x8
1x m3x12 to 16 (whatever fits for you. if it sticks out a bit longer it doesn't matter. purely aesthetics)
3x m2x6 (m2 x 4 can also be used if you have those on hand)

Screw the PCB on the webcam_mount using the 3x m2's

attach the webcam swivelmount to the top extrusion with the 2 T-nuts and the 2x m3x's.
It'll end up looking like this:

Now route the cable through a slot in the 2020 profile and use a printed insert to keep the cable nice and tidy.
I used this one that fits perfect in my LDO frame : https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1478147
